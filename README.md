# msg-encryption

This is a project made in C to try and understand the basics of asymmetric encryption.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Use RSA algorithm
- [ ] Create a messaging client with local sockets
- [ ] Create a program to bruteforce the keys

## Disclaimer
This code should not be used for security purposes and is only made to demonstrate how asymmetric encryption works.

The mathematic implementation of the RSA algorithm was inspired from [this repository](https://github.com/andrewkiluk/RSA-Library).

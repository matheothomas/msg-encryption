# msg-encryption

This is a project made in C to try and understand the basics of asymmetric encryption.

## Roadmap

- [x] Use RSA algorithm
- [ ] Create a messaging client with local sockets
- [ ] Create a program to bruteforce the keys

## Disclaimer
This code should not be used for **security purposes** and is only made to demonstrate how asymmetric encryption works.

## Installation
Clone the repository and compile the code with :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/matheothomas/msg-encryption
cd msg-encryption/src
make
```

Execute the program with
```bash
./main
```


The mathematic implementation of the RSA algorithm was highly inspired from [this repository](https://github.com/andrewkiluk/RSA-Library).
